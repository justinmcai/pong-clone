### Requirement 1: Paddles / Players (50%)
- There needs to be a paddle on each side that can move independently to the other. COMPLETED
- The ball needs to bounce off of the paddles. COMPLETED
- The paddles should not be able to go off the top or bottom of the screen. COMPLETED - HARDCODED WINDOW BOUNDARY (ALLOWED)
- Both players should be allowed to use the keyboard. For instance, player 1 could use the W and S keys, while player 2 would use the Up and Down arrows. COMPLETED
- If the player presses the t-key, one of the paddles should switch from player-controlled to a simple up-and-down motion. In other words, we are simulating the player switching from 2-player mode to 1-player mode. Make sure that the user can't use their keys to move the paddle when in 1-player mode. PARTIALLY COMPLETED (CPU PADDLE DOESN'T CHANGE DIRECTIONS)
- All objects in your scene must be textured. COMPLETED
### Requirement 2: Bounces Off Walls (25%)
- The ball needs to bounce off the top and bottom of the screen. COMPLETED - HARDCODED WINDOW BOUNDARY (ALLOWED)
### Requirement 3: Game Over (25%)
- The game should stop when someone wins or loses (i.e. when the ball hits a wall on the left or right). COMPLETED - THE APP IS STILL RUNNING, BUT NOTHING IS ALLOWED TO MOVE
### Extra Credit
- Have fun with it and have a theme. Instead of square paddles and a ball, have other kinds of objects/images with the same mechanics. It doesn't need to be super polishedâ€“anything that looks fun is welcome. COMPLETED - BLUE LOCK THEME :D
- Have an endgame UI message. When someone wins, you can show an image of text saying who won. PARTIALLY COMPLETED (SHOW UP BUT LOOKS WEIRD, GRAY BOX)
- Have an option to choose number of balls. Allow the player to press number keys from 1-3 and generate that number of balls on the screen (do NOT generate more than 3 balls). Player should be able to change the number of balls any time during the game. COMPLETED
